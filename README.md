# Tozny React Native Example

Install pods for IOS.
```
cd ios
pod install
```

Then at the root of the project:
```
yarn
```

Once everything is setup, start:
```
yarn start
```


At the moment a file record does not upload from a base64 string. There are 3 examples in `app/services/ToznyService.js` that I've attempted at. Just uncomment or change as necessary.
